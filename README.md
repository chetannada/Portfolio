# 🚀 Chetan Nada's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a handcrafted showcase of my journey as a **Frontend Developer** and **Full-Stack Architect**. Originally built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project has now evolved into a modern, modular, and expressive experience powered by:

- **Next.js** for performance and scalability
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability
- **TailwindCSS** for rapid, responsive styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, delightful animations

## 🧠 About This Project

This portfolio is more than a resume — it's a living canvas where I experiment with:

- ✨ Emotionally resonant branding and layout naming
- ⚙️ Modular architecture and reusable components
- 🎨 Theme-aware particle effects and custom SVG illustrations

Every detail is intentional — from icon alignment to animation polish.
